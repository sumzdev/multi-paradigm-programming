## 3.1 Code Is Data – A List Containing Logic

Chapters 1 and 2 covered the process of applying functional programming, list processing, metaprogramming, and a functional type system in multiparadigm languages. In this chapter, we’ll bring all that discussion into real-world scenarios by writing functional code to solve problems you might encounter in daily life. The first step is to replace imperative code with list-processing functions.

### [for, i++, if, break] – Thinking of Code as a List

Viewing code as a list is a powerful tool for expanding your programming paradigms. In functional programming, the principle that code is data and data is code enables developers to produce code that is more readable and maintainable. In this section, we will explore how to process code as a list by transforming imperative constructs such as `for`, `i++`, `if`, and `break` into functional list-processing functions.

#### An Imperative Function That Squares n Odd Numbers and Sums Them All

[Code 3-1] shows a function that squares n odd numbers and sums them all. When this code is executed, it selects the first three odd numbers (1, 3, 5) from the `list` array, calculates their squares (`1^2`, `3^2`, `5^2`), and adds them up. The final sum, `1 + 9 + 25 = 35`, is printed.

##### [Code 3-1] Summing the Squares of n Odd Numbers

```typescript
function sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(limit: number, list: number[]): number {
  let acc = 0;
  for (const a of list) {
    if (a % 2 === 1) {
      const b = a * a;
      acc += b;
      if (--limit === 0) break;
    }
  }
  return acc;
}

console.log(
  sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
);
// 35
```

We will now transform this code into a functional style while exploring how to handle code as a list.

Let’s recap what `sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers` is doing, in list form:

1. **Iteration**: `for (const a of list)` iterates through each element of `list`. The variable `a` represents the current element of the array.
2. **Odd Check**: Using `if (a % 2 === 1)`, the code checks whether `a` is odd. If it is odd, it proceeds to the next step.
3. **Square Calculation**: `const b = a * a;` calculates the square of the odd number `a` and stores it in `b`.
4. **Accumulated Sum Update**: `acc += b;` adds `b` to the accumulated sum.
5. **Length Check & Exit**: `if (--limit === 0) break;` decreases `limit`, and if `limit` reaches 0, it breaks out of the loop.
6. **Return Result**: `return acc;` returns the final accumulated sum.

#### Replacing if with filter

We can replace the `if` statement with a `filter` function.

##### [Code 3-2] Replacing if with filter

```typescript
function sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(limit: number, list: number[]): number {
  let acc = 0;
  for (const a of filter(a => a % 2 === 1, list)) {
    const b = a * a;
    acc += b;
    if (--limit === 0) break;
  }
  return acc;
}

console.log(
  sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
);
// 35
```

Here, we replaced the `list` part of [Code 3-1] with `filter(...)` and moved the condition `if (a % 2 === 1) {}` into the callback function for `filter`, removing the original conditional. Now that `filter(a => a % 2 === 1, list)` leaves only odd numbers, the inner code of the `for` loop, which calculates squares and sums them, becomes one step simpler.

In this example, we transformed **a code statement that controlled execution** with `if (a % 2 === 1) {}` after extracting `a` from `list` into a filtered list using the `filter` method. The code inside the `for...of` loop doesn't need to know whether `a` is filtered or not; it simply squares each element and adds it to the sum.

To summarize what we've covered so far:

1. Scattered **code statements** have been replaced by **list processing function executions**
2. `filter(a => a % 2 === 1, list)` is both **code** that performs filter logic and a **list**.
3. The conditional has been removed from the internal logic, making the code clearer and simpler.

#### Replacing the Variable Assignment after Value Transformation with map

Through this example, we are learning together how to gradually refactor code into a functional style without touching its overall structure. Now, let's use `map` to eliminate variable assignments after value transformations.

##### [Code 3-3] Code Replaced by map

```typescript
function sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(limit: number, list: number[]): number {
  let acc = 0;
  for (const a of map(a => a * a, filter(a => a % 2 === 1, list))) {
    acc += a;
    if (--limit === 0) break;
  }
  return acc;
}

console.log(
  sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
);
// 35
```

In this example, map has replaced the code `const b = a * a;`, which declares a variable and assigns it the squared value. Consequently, `map(a => a * a, filter(a => a % 2 === 1, list))` has become a lazy iterator that creates a list of squared odd numbers, and we're extracting these squared values of a by iterating through it with the `for...of` loop.

Once more, the code statements are being altered to incorporate a combination of lists and functions. To convey this concept more effectively, it would be preferable to describe this code in LISP syntax. This is due to the fact that LISP syntax more represents the concept of treating code as a list.

[Code 3-4] is code written in Scheme, a LISP-family language.

##### [Code 3-4] Scheme Code

```scheme
; Scheme
(define list '(1 2 3 4 5))

(define (square x) (* x x))

(map square (filter odd? list))
; (1 9 25)

; JavaScript
; map(square, filter(isOdd, list))
```

As demonstrated in [Code 3-4], the syntax for creating a `list`, such as `(1 2 3 4 5)`, and the syntax for calculating the square of x using the multiplication operator `x` in `(* x x)` are identical, with the exception of the single quote ('). In LISP, both the syntax for defining data, such as numeric arrays, and expressions for calculations, such as squaring, are represented as lists. Moreover, function calls are also notated as lists; the list `(* x x)` contains one `*` and two `x`, and when this list-as-code is evaluated, it computes the square of `x`.

Examining `(filter odd? list)` from the same perspective, it is a list containing `filter`, `odd?`, and `list`. Since `list` is `(1 2 3 4 5)`, `(filter odd? list)` effectively becomes a nested list: `(filter odd? '(1 2 3 4 5))`. Similarly, `(map square (filter odd? list))` is a multi-level nested list, as shown in [Code 3-4a].

##### [Code 3-4a] Scheme Code

```scheme
(map (lambda (x) (* x x)) (filter odd? '(1 2 3 4 5)))
```

In LISP, the program are executed by evaluating expressions that serve as lists, code, and data. In this language, lists are code, code is lists, and nested lists embody both algorithms and logic. LISP's syntax beautifully reflects this philosophy and expresses it with remarkable elegance.

TypeScript, the primary language used in this book, differs only slightly in syntax from LISP. Thanks to its iteration protocol based on iterable and iterators, you can directly apply the same paradigm-as demonstrated by the examples provided so far.

#### Replacing break with take

Now we’ll replace `if (--limit === 0) break;` with `take`.

##### [Code 3-5] Code Replaced by take

```typescript
function* take<A>(limit: number, iterable: Iterable<A>): IterableIterator<A> {
  const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
  while (true) {
    const { value, done } = iterator.next();
    if (done) break;
    yield value;
    if (--limit === 0) break;
  }
}

function sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(limit: number, list: number[]): number {
  let acc = 0;
  for (const a of take(limit, map(a => a * a, filter(a => a % 2 === 1, list)))) {
    acc += a;
  }
  return acc;
}

console.log(
  sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
);
// 35
```

The `take` function returns a lazy iterable iterator that produces a lazy list, yielding elements from the given iterable up to the specified `limit`. In this case, it returns only the first three elements.

In [Code 3-5], `take(limit, map(a => a * a, filter(a => a % 2 === 1, list)))` is lazily evaluated, meaning no computations occur until explicitly requested. When the `for...of` loop retrieves values, it returns `1` on the first iteration, `9` on the second, and finally `25`, after which the loop concludes.

We should note that even though we’ve removed the `break` statement that would normally exit the loop, the time complexity remains the same. The `break` keyword enhances efficiency by ensuring that the loop executes only as many iterations as necessary. Through `take`, we’ve demonstrated that even control statements like `break` can be conceptualized as **lists**. Lazy evaluation is the key enabling factor for this approach, which we’ll explore more thoroughly in section ‘3.3 Looking Deeper into Lazy Evaluation’.

Looking at the remaining imperative code, we can see it's essentially identical to an implementation of `reduce`.

#### Summation with reduce

Finally, let’s replace the imperative summation code with one that uses the `reduce` function.

##### [Code 3-6] Replacing with reduce

```typescript
const sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers = (limit: number, list: number[]): number => 
  reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0,               // add(add(1, 9), 25)
    take(limit,                            // [(1), (9), (25)]
      map(a => a * a,                      // [(1), (9), (25), (49), (81)]
        filter(a => a % 2 === 1, list)))); // [(1), (3), (5), (7), (9)]

console.log(
  sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
);
// 35
```

As it evaluates this lazy list, `reduce` extracts elements. It first accumulates by adding the first element (`1`) and the second element (`9`), and then adds the third element (`25`) to yield a final result of `35`.

#### Switching to a Chaining Style

Because `take` is used frequently, let’s add a `take` method to `FxIterable` so that we can write the code in a more readable, sequential manner.

##### [Code 3-7] Chaining

```typescript
class FxIterable<A> {
  constructor(private iterable: Iterable<A>) {}

  // ... omitted methods ...

  take(limit: number): FxIterable<A> {
    return fx(take(limit, this)); // new FxIterable(take(limit, this));
  }
}

// Functional code: 
const sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers = (limit: number, list: number[]): number =>
  fx(list)                       // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    .filter(a => a % 2 === 1)    // [(1), (3), (5), (7), (9)]
    .map(a => a * a)             // [(1), (9), (25), (49), (81)]
    .take(limit)                 // [(1), (9), (25)]
    .reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0); // add(add(1, 9), 25)

console.log(
  sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(3, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
);
// 35

// Imperative code: 
// function sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(limit: number, list: number[]): number {
//   let acc = 0;
//   for (const a of list) {
//     if (a % 2 === 1) {
//       const b = a * a;
//       acc += b;
//       if (--limit === 0) break;
//     }
//   }
//   return acc;
// }
```

We have now transformed the imperative function into a functional programming style. The code has become more declarative, significantly enhancing readability. By using descriptive function names like `filter`, `map`, `take`, and `reduce`, the purpose of each code segment is clear, and the sequence of operations can be easily followed from top to bottom.

All parts of the code have been replaced with list-processing functions, essentially producing nested lists.

#### What sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers Does, in List Form

Let’s revisit what the imperative implementation of `sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers` accomplished:

1. **Iteration**: `for (const a of list)` iterates through each element of `list`. `a` is the current element of the array.
2. **Odd Check**: The condition `if (a % 2 === 1)`checks whether `a` is odd, proceeding only if it is.
3. **Square Calculation**: The statements `const b = a * a;` computes the square of `a` and stores it in `b`.
4. **Accumulated Sum Update**: The statements `acc += b;` adds `b` to the accumulator `acc`.
5. **Length Check & Exit**: The condition `if (--limit === 0) break;` decreases `limit` and exits the loop when it reaches 0.
6. **Return Result**: Finally `return acc;` returns the accumulated sum.

This sequence is replaced by the following  **list-represented** functional code:

1. **Iteration**: `fx(list)` creates a lazy list to iterate over.
2. **Odd Check**: `filter(a => a % 2 === 1)` yields a lazy list containing only odd numbers.
3. **Square Calculation**: `map(a => a * a)` produces a lazy list where each element is the square of the filtered numbers.
4. **Length Check & Exit**: `take(limit)` produces a lazy list limited to `limit` elements.
5. **Accumulated Sum Update**: `reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)` sums all the elements.
6. **Return Result**: `=> ((()))` returns the accumulated sum.

List processing, as demonstrated, effectively transforms lines of imperative code into lists. By treating code as values (lists) and functions as first-class citizens, complex problems are solved by composing small, modular blocks of code. This is the essence of functional programming and list processing, enabling the decomposition of intricate logic into manageable, self-contained list elements. Consequently, code implemented with list processing is more readable, easier to maintain, and each component's role is distinctly defined. 

### List Processing in Modern Languages – Clojure, Kotlin, Swift, Scala, C#, Java

Modern programming languages support functional programming paradigms that align with the list-processing philosophy we have discussed. In [Code 3-7], we implement the complete functional code in various languages to verify this approach.

#### Implementing sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers in Other Languages

##### [Code 3-8] Clojure

```clojure
(defn square [x]
  (* x x))

(defn sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers [limit list]
  (->> list
       (filter odd?)
       (map square)
       (take limit)
       (reduce +)))

(println (sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers 3 [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9])) 
; 35
```

[Code 3-8] is written in Clojure, a language focused on the functional programming paradigm. While not primarily the multiparadigm language this book focuses on, Clojure is a modern LISP-family language with strong interoperability with Java and widespread usage in various communities, providing significant inspiration.

`->>` is a macro that allows pipeline-like expressions. It takes code like `(filter odd?)`, `(map square)`, etc., which expect sequences to arrive later, applies them consecutively to `list`, then feeds each result into subsequent functions. And in true LISP spirit, you can pass the `+` symbol as the reducer function to `reduce`.

##### [Code 3-9] Kotlin

```kotlin
fun sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(limit: Int, list: List<Int>): Int {
    return list.asSequence()
        .filter { it % 2 == 1 }
        .map { it * it }
        .take(limit)
        .fold(0) { a, b -> a + b }
}

fun main() {
    val result = sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(3, listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9))
    println(result)  // 35
}
```

Kotlin supports iteration via the `Iterable` interface, using `asSequence()` to enable lazy operations. The standard library provides a high level of functional programming support, including higher-order functions like `filter`, `map`, `take`, `reduce`, and `fold`. It also offers concise, unique lambda syntax using the keyword `it` to refer to the current item. Kotlin’s robust type system, combined with its classes, makes it a multiparadigm language that also delivers readable, succinct functional code.

##### [Code 3-10] Swift

```swift
func sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(limit: Int, list: [Int]) -> Int {
    return list.lazy                   
        .filter { $0 % 2 == 1 }        
        .map { $0 * $0 }               
        .prefix(limit)           // same as take
        .reduce(0, +)            // Swift’s reduce requires an initial value, cannot omit
}

print(sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(limit: 3, list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]))
// 35
```

Swift uses the `lazy` keyword to enable lazy operations, combining it with the sequence protocol for high-performance lazy evaluation. Swift’s standard library provides higher-order functions like `filter`, `map`, `prefix`, and `reduce`, while its strong type inference keeps the code concise. Moreover, Swift performs extensive optimizations at compile time, maintaining high performance even with code using higher-order functions like lazy evaluation. It’s also appealing that the `reduce` function can directly use the `+` operator as its accumulator function.

Swift strongly supports the functional paradigm but can also combine it with imperative and object-oriented paradigms. Additionally, Apple’s powerful SDK and platforms enable the development of elegant, high-performing UI/UX apps for its devices and operating systems, making the language all the more distinctive.

##### [Code 3-11] Scala

```scala
object Main extends App {
  def sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(limit: Int, list: List[Int]): Int = {
    list.to(LazyList)
      .filter(_ % 2 == 1)
      .map(a => a * a)
      .take(limit)
      .foldLeft(0)(_ + _)
  }

  println(sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(3, List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9))) 
  // 35
}
```

Scala is also a multi-paradigm language that combines functional programming and object-oriented programming, offering high-level functional programming capabilities. By using `LazyList`, Scala supports lazy evaluation, computing elements only when necessary to enhance processing efficiency.

In Scala’s lambda expressions, you can use an underscore (`_`) to refer to the current element, or you can use explicit lambda expressions such as `a => a * a`. Additionally, Scala provides concise syntax like `(_ + _)`. When the compiler clearly knows how many arguments a function needs, it infers that number and creates an anonymous function accordingly. For example, based on the fact that the partially applied `foldLeft(0)` requires a function with two parameters, the compiler interprets `_ + _` as a function that takes two arguments and sums them. It’s a remarkably concise style of expression.

##### [Code 3-12] C#

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class LispTest
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        List<int> list = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
        int result = SumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(3, list);
        Console.WriteLine(result); // 35
    }

    static int SumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(int limit, List<int> list)
    {
        return list.Where(a => a % 2 == 1)
                   .Select(a => a * a)
                   .Take(limit)
                   .Aggregate(0, (a, b) => a + b);
    }
}
```

C# supports advanced functional programming capabilities through its LINQ (Language Integrated Query) feature. Developers can write concise and highly readable code using higher-order functions such as `Where`, `Select`, `Take`, and `Aggregate`—which correspond directly to the functional programming concepts of `filter`, `map`, `take`, and reduce respectively.

##### [Code 3-13] C# SQL-Style Syntax

```csharp
static int SumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(int limit, List<int> list)
{
    var query = from num in list
                where num % 2 == 1
                select num * num;

    return query.Take(limit).Aggregate(0, (acc, a) => acc + a);
}
```

In particular, LINQ offers the unique advantage of supporting SQL-like syntax for certain operations. By utilizing SQL-like keywords such as `from`, `where`, and `select`, developers can craft SQL-resembling expressions without the need for additional brackets or symbols in their programming language-a particularly appealing feature. This design choice likely explains why the functions were named `where` and `select` instead of the functional programming standards `filter` and `map`. The LINQ query syntax is especially intuitive for developers with SQL, experience, significantly enhancing the readability of data queries and transformations.

C# introduced LINQ in November 2007, demonstrating that it has been a pioneering multi-paradigm language that integrated functional programming concepts long before many other mainstream languages.

##### [Code 3-14] Java

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);
        int result = sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(3, list);
        System.out.println(result); // 35
    }

    public static int sumOfSquaresOfOddNumbers(int limit, List<Integer> list) {
        return list.stream()
                   .filter(a -> a % 2 == 1)
                   .map(a -> a * a)
                   .limit(limit)              // same as take
                   .reduce(0, Integer::sum); 
    }
}
```


Java supports functional programming through its `Stream` API. You can transform and process collections using stream methods like `filter`, `map`, `limit`, and `reduce`. Java’s lambda expressions are concise and expressive, and when combined with the `Stream` API, they make manipulating complex data straightforward.
`Stream.reduce` in Java comes in two forms: one requiring an initial value, and another that requires an `Optional` without an initial value. When omitting the initial value, you receive an `Optional`, necessitating additional steps to unwrap the actual value.

> Note that It's worth noting that each language's `reduce` method handles the initial value slightly differently. These design choices aim to either prevent unexpected situations or help developers discover them—specifically when encountering empty collections (arrays, streams, or iterables) at runtime that could cause errors. The languages essentially suggest appropriate handling methods to developers. In TypeScript and JavaScript specifically, when no initial value is provided and the `reduce` method encounters an empty array or iterable, it propagates an error.

### Concepts and Paradigms Applicable Across Languages.

The languages we've examined-JavaScript, TypeScript, Clojure, Kotlin, Swift, Scala, C#, and Java-each support lazy evaluation through their unique iteration protocols or similar mechanisms. By implementing functional programming principles at the language level, they enhance code readability and maintainability while maximizing data processing efficiency.

Modern languages are actively adopting and refining function paradigm, with some optimizing functional code during compilation. Even Java, traditionally a object-oriented language, has evolved into a multi-paradigm language featuring a rich set of functional higher-order functions.

JavaScript particularly enables high-level functional library implementation through various protocols like `Iterable`, `Iterator`, `Generator`, `AsyncGenerator`, and `AsyncIterator`. The ECMAScript Stage 3 “Iterator Helpers” specification aims for functionality nearly identical to what we've implemented in this book, and will eventually provide built-in helper functions supporting lazy evaluation at the language level.

Ultimately, multi-paradigm thinking and problem-solving abilities that combine object-oriented, imperative, and functional approaches transcend specific languages. Languages with robust type systems and type inference—such as TypeScript, Kotlin, Swift, Scala, C#, and Java—allow developers to leverage classes, interfaces, iteration protocols, and functional higher-order functions simultaneously. The concepts and principles covered in this book apply across these languages, contributing to safer and more efficient code implementation across diverse environments.

[^6]: In Scheme, the single quote (`'`) represents the `quote` operator, indicating that the following expression should not be evaluated but treated as a literal list. In other words, `'` creates a list. For example, `(1 2 3)` could be interpreted as a function call, but putting `'` in front of it turns it into a list whose elements are not evaluated. To recap, `(* 2 2)` as a function call evaluates to 4, whereas `'(1 2 3)` is data, a list structure, not a function call.
